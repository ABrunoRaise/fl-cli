# fl

This is the repository for the CLI of the Funless (FL) platform, a new generation research-driven serverless platform.

The CLI can be used both to deploy the platform and to create, delete and invoke functions on it.

## Using the CLI

The CLI currently exposes two sets of commands, `fn` and `admin`, for function manipulation and deployment respectively.
### fn

The `fn` commands are used to create, delete and invoke functions.

#### `fn create`

#### `fn delete`

#### `fn invoke`

### admin

#### `admin dev`

#### `admin reset`
